Ship Management Program

Description
This C++ program manages ship data, allowing the user to input and display information for multiple ships.

Features
-   Takes ship names, number of passengers, and weight capacity as input.
-   Stores and displays ship details.
-   Utilizes classes and objects to represent ships.
-   Demonstrates the use of constructors, getters, and setters.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `a3.cpp`: Contains the main function, which handles user input and output, and creates Ship objects.
-   `a2.cpp`:  Contains the implementation of the Ship class methods (constructors, getters, setters).
-   `a1.cpp`: Contains the declaration of the Ship class.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For handling string data (ship names).

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., a3.cpp, a2.cpp, a1.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
